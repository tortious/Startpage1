### Introduction

Before sending a Pull Request, make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue. It wouldn't be good if your contribution is rejected because it's ideologically incompatible, or overlap with another persons contributions.

* If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and ask to be assigned on it.
* If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself.
